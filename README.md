# CiriSolarSystem
Ciri is red dwarf star located in the X91 quadrant at the galaxy's edge. Arround it five planets translate. One of them, Muna, is the where most of the action of my future sci-fi book will take place. 
This project aims to be a trivia for those who wish to know more about Muna and its neighboors.
