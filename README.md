# CiriSolarSystem
Ciri is a red dwarf star located in the X91 quadrant at the galaxy's edge. Around it, five planets translate. One of them, Muna, is where most of the action of my future sci-fi book will take place. This project aims to be a trivia for those who wish to know more about Muna and its neighbors.
